This profile sets minimum expectations for the [Observation] resource to record, search and fetch pediatric weight for height and age observations associated with a patient. It is based on the FHIR [Vital Signs Profile] and identifies the *additional* mandatory core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets which **SHALL** be present in the Observation resource when using this profile.

**Example Usage Scenarios:**

The following are example usage scenarios for the US Core Pediatric Weight for Height Observation Profile:

- Query for pediatric weight observations belonging to a pediatric patient
- Record pediatric weight observations belonging to a pediatric patient

### Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements

In addition to the mandatory and must support data elements in the FHIR Vital Signs Profile, the following data-elements are mandatory (i.e data MUST be present) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system ([Must Support] definition).

The [Formal Profile Definition] below provides the  formal summary, definitions, and  terminology requirements.

**Each Observation must have:**

1.  a fixed code for pediatric weight for height and age measurement
1.  a result value

**Profile specific implementation guidance:**
